The cat is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the 
only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the 
domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family. A cat can either 
be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human 
contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to 
hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.

Cats were first domesticated in the Near East around 7500 BCE. It was long thought 
that cat domestication was initiated in ancient Egypt, as since around 3100 BCE 
veneration was given to cats in ancient Egypt. As of 2017, the domestic cat was the 
second-most popular pet in the United States, with 95 million cats owned. In the 
United Kingdom, around 7 million cats lived in more than 4 million households 
as of 2019.
